      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m Kiran Krishna Nair , born in 2006 and I come from Navi Mumbai.
        Currently doing undergraduation from IIM bangalore. I have completed my
        schooling from DAV Publlic School, New Panvel. I had the opportunity to
        be the part of school council, I was the captain of my house,
        Takshashila. I had organized numerous events in school, which not only
        honed my leadership skills but also taught me the importance of
        effective teamwork and coordination. Outside of my academic pursuits, I
        have a keen interest in analyzing business, economics and political case
        studies. It's something I'm passionate about, and I often dedicate my
        free time watching videos about it. I also enjoy participating in Model
        United Nations (MUNs) as they offer a unique perspective on global
        politics and demonstrate how international diplomacy and decision-making
        processes unfold.
      </p>
      <p>
        Iâ€™ve grown up in a world of rapid change, where the concept of
        confidence isnâ€™t just a traitâ€”itâ€™s a tool that shapes the future. My
        hometown, Thrissur in Kerala, is where my roots lie. Let me tell you
        Known for its cultural grandeur, Thrissur is the heart of Keralaâ€™s
        traditional festivals, with the Thrissur Pooram being an iconic event.
        Itâ€™s a celebration of faith, culture, and unity, where thousands gather
        to witness a spectacular procession of elephants adorned with gold and
        ornaments. Thrissur teaches you the importance of community strength and
        unwavering confidence in oneâ€™s cultural identity.

    <h2>Achievements</h2>
    <p>
      My biggest achievement has been my personal growth journey, particularly in the area of communication and confidence-building. Up until the 10th standard, I was incredibly shy and introverted. However, everything changed in the 11th standard. It was a pivotal year for me. I decided to step out of my comfort zone and take on new challenges. Joining the school council was a turning point. Through my involvement, I had opportunities to anchor on stage during various events. Initially, it was daunting, but with each experience, my public speaking skills began to develop, and my confidence started to grow. Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy participating in Model United Nations (MUNs) and I also have a keen interest in analyzing business and political case studies.
